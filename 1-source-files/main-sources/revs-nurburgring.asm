\ where each section is one of the following shapes:
\
\   || is a straight section that doesn't curve to the left or right, and has
\      the same gradient throughout the whole section
\
\   {} is a straight section in the sense that it doesn't curve to the left or
\      right, but the gradient can differ between sub-sections
\
\   -> consists of sub-sections that all curve to the right
\
\   <- consists of sub-sections that all curve to the left
\
\   |->| consists of sub-sections that are either straight or curve to the right
\
\   |<-| consists of sub-sections that are either straight or curve to the left
\
\   |<->| consists of sub-sections that are either straight or curve to the left
\         or right
\
\ This part defines the following aspects of these track sections:
\
\ trackSectionData      Various data for the track section:
\
\                         * Bits 0-2: Size of the track section list
\
\                           Defines the number of entries that we store in the
\                           track section list for this section, which is used
\                           to calculate the coordinates of the track verges
\                           (higher numbers mean more sections are calculated,
\                           so higher numbers are used for more complex parts
\                           of the track)
\
\                           This value is given in the bottom nibble of the
\                           track section data byte (bit 3 is ignored), i.e. the
\                           second digit in the hexadecimal value
\
\                         * Bits 4-7: Sign number
\
\                           The number of the road sign (0 to 15) to show when
\                           we enter this section, but only if the sign number
\                           is different to the number in the previous section
\
\                           This value is given in the top nibble of the track
\                           section data byte, i.e. the first digit in the
\                           hexadecimal value
\
\ xTrackSectionIHi      High byte of the x-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the inner verge of each track section
\
\ yTrackSectionIHi      High byte of the y-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the inner verge of each track section
\
\ zTrackSectionIHi      High byte of the z-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the inner verge of each track section
\
\ xTrackSectionOHi      High byte of the x-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the outside verge of each track section
\
\ trackSectionTurn      The number of the segment towards the end of the section
\                       where non-player cars should start turning in
\                       preparation for the next section
\
\ zTrackSectionOHi      High byte of the z-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the outside verge of each track section
\
\ trackDriverSpeed      The maximum speed for non-player drivers on the next
\                       section of the track
\
\ Some of the trackDriverSpeed values have been scaled down by a factor of 1.44
\ from the Commodore 64 version. This applies to sections that are followed by
\ sections with bit 7 of trackSectionFlag set.
\
\ Those sections are 1, 5, 7, 10, 16, 18 and 22, and this scaling is noted in
\ the comments below.
\
\ See part 2 of the track section data for each section's trackSectionFlag,
\ where Sp=1 denotes sections with bit 7 of trackSectionFlag set (so we scale
\ trackDriverSpeed in the sections that precede these).

\
\ This routine is called from GetSegmentAngles to change the logic in at label
\ gseg12, which is applied when a segment is outside the field of view. Note
\ that in the following, the previous segment is further away than the current
\ one.
\
\ In the original code:
\
\   * If previous segment's yaw angle >= 20 then the previous segment was also
\     outside the field of view, so return from the subroutine.
\
\   * Otherwise go to gseg4 to try reducing the size of the segment before
\     returning.
\
\ In the new code:
\
\   * If previous segment's yaw angle >= 20 and segmentCounter >= 10, then the
\     previous segment was also outside the field of view AND we have already
\     marked at least 10 segments as being visible, so return from the
\     subroutine.
\
\   * Otherwise go to gseg13 to mark this segment as visible and keep checking
\     segments.
\
\ So in the modified version, we keep checking segments until we have reached at
\ least 10.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called from MapSegmentsToLines to flatten the height of the
\ verge entries in the verge buffer that are hidden by the nearest hill to the
\ player, so that the ground behind the nearest hill is effectively levelled
\ off.
\
\ It also sets horizonTrackWidth to 80% of the track width at the hill crest,
\ and sets the verge edge to being visible when the car is pointing along the
\ track and the nose is pointing downwards (though the latter part is only done
\ if we are looking at track sections 0 to 5 down the hill).

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called from GetTrackAndMarkers. It does the following:
\
\  * Cut objects off at the track line in A rather than horizonLine
\
\  * Collapse the left verge of the track into the right verge, but only for a
\    few entries just in front of the horizon section, i.e. for the track
\    section list and the first three entries in the track segment list
\
\  * If the track section at the horizon is one of sections 0 to 5, zero the
\    vergeDataRight and vergeDataLeft entries for the horizon section index to
\    hide the verge
\

\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The updated value of horizonLine
\
\   Y                   The horizon section index in the verge buffer from

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called from part 5 of ApplyElevation to jump the car off the
\ ground when driving fast over sloping segments.
\
\ If the car is on the ground, replace the heightAboveTrack * 4 part of the
\ car's y-coordinate calculation with playerSpeedHi * yTrackSegmentI * 4, to
\ give:
\
\   (yPlayerCoordTop yPlayerCoordHi)=   (ySegmentCoordIHi ySegmentCoordILo)
\                                      + carProgress * yTrackSegmentI

\                                      + 172
\
\ So driving fast over sloping segments can make the car jump.

\       Name: trackSubConfig
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Extra tracks
\    Summary: Configuration data for each section that defines the sub-section
\             numbers, and horizon calculations
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Each section has a trackSubConfig value that contains the following data:
\
\   * Bits 2 to 7= the number of the first sub-section in this section
\
\   * Bit 1= if this is set, then in the horizon calculations, we skip the
\             check that sets horizonLine to 7
\
\   * Bit 0= if this is set, then the segment vectors for this section are
\             generated as a straight track rather than using the curve tables
\             (this bit is only set for straight sections)
\
\ In the last one, if bit 0 is set then bit 7 of subSection gets set. This makes
\ us skip the first part of the SetSegmentVector routine, which means we do not
\ update the yaw angle or track height before calculating the segment vector.
\ This means we reuse the segment vector from the end of the previous section
\ for generating this track section. This is only done for straight sections,
\ and the main game code draws straight sections by simply adding the same track
\ segment vector for each segment in the straight, so setting bit 0 of a
\ section's trackSubConfig ensures that it heads off in a straight line in the
\ exact same direction as the tail end of the preceding section.

\
\   * Bit 1 clear means the result is multiplied by baseSpeed, so steering on

\
\   * Bits 2 to 7 contain the amount of steering to apply

\      right, but the gradient can differ between sub-sections
\
\   -> consists of sub-sections that all curve to the right

\ This part defines the following aspects of these track sections:
\
\ trackSectionFlag      Various flags for the track section

\                       given track section (note that because the segment
\                       vectors in this track are dynamically generated, this
\                       value points to the position in the segment vector
\                       table where the section's first vector will be stored
\                       once it is generated)

\   Category: Extra tracks
\    Summary: Apply enhanced joystick steering to specific track sections
\  Deep dive: Secrets of the extra tracks
\             Code hooks in the extra tracks
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called from ProcessDrivingKeys to scale the steering in the
\ following sections to make it easier to steer when using a joystick:
\
\   * Section 8: scale the steering by 1.28
\
\   * Section 11: scale the steering by 1.37
\
\   * Section 26: scale the steering by 1.25
\
\ Specifically, the scaling is applied as follows:
\
\   (A T)= scale_factor * x-axis ^ 2
\
\ which replaces this existing code in ProcessDrivingKeys:
\
\   (A T)= x-axis^2
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   U                   The joystick x-axis high byte
\
\   A                   The joystick x-axis high byte

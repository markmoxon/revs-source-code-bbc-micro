\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the MakeSound passes the bytes in this table to
\ OSWORD 7. These bytes are the OSWORD equivalents of the parameters passed to
\ the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters have these meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ where each value consists of two bytes, with the low byte first and the high
\ byte second.
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the top nibble of the low byte is the flush
\ control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound, and a flush control of
\ 1 makes the sound instantly), while the bottom nibble of the low byte is the
\ channel number. When written in hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush
\ control, while the second is the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1
\ and channel = 3).

\       Name: GetObjectDistance
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: 3D objects
\    Summary: Calculate the distance between an object and the player's car, for
\             collision purposes
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called with the smaller yaw angle of the object, where 0 to
\ 255 represents 0 to 45 degrees, so 103 = 18.2 degrees. The smaller viewing
\ angle is taken from the arctan calculation for the yaw angle calculation in
\ GetObjYawAngle, so that's the triangle whose hypotenuse is the line between
\ the player and the object, and whose other sides are parallel to the x-axis
\ and z-axis.
\
\ If the smaller yaw angle is < 18.2 degrees, the routine does this:
\
\   * Set (L K) = (J I) + (H G) / 8
\               = max + min / 8
\
\ If the smaller yaw angle is >= 18.2 degrees, the routine does this:
\
\   * Set (L K) = (J I) * 7/8 + (H G) / 2
\               = max * 7/8 + min / 2
\
\ This appears to set the distance between the object and the player's car, for
\ the purposes of determining whether contact has been made.
\
\ I suspect the calculation is an approximation of Pythagoras that is much
\ faster to calculate, split into small yaw angles (when the objects are
\ close to being orthogonal to each other) and larger yaw angles (when their
\ relative positions are closer to the diagonal). This is a guess, though.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (J I)               max(|x-delta|, |z-delta|)
\
\   (H G)               min(|x-delta|, |z-delta|)
\
\   M                   The smaller yaw angle of the object, where 0 to 255
\                       represents 0 to 45 degrees, so 103 = 18.2 degrees
\
\ Returns:

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine calculates:
\
\   (A T) = (QQ PP) * (SS RR) / 256^2
\
\ It uses the following algorithm:
\
\  (QQ PP) * (SS RR) = (QQ << 8 + PP) * (SS << 8 + RR)
\                    = (QQ << 8 * SS << 8) + (QQ << 8 * RR)
\                                          + (PP * SS << 8)
\                                          + (PP * RR)
\                    = (QQ * SS) << 16 + (QQ * RR) << 8

\                                      + (PP * RR)
\
\ Finally, it replaces the low byte multiplication in (PP * RR) with 128, as an
\ estimate, as it's a pain to multiply the low bytes of a signed integer with a
\ sign-magnitude number. So the final result that is returned in (A T) is as
\ follows:
\
\   (A T) = (QQ PP) * (SS RR) / 256^2
\         = ((QQ * SS) << 16 + (QQ * RR) << 8 + (PP * SS) << 8 + 128) / 256^2
\
\ which is the algorithm that is implemented in this routine.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (QQ PP)             16-bit signed integer
\
\   (SS RR)             16-bit sign-magnitude integer with the sign bit in bit 0

\       Name: SortDrivers
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drivers
\    Summary: Create a sorted list of driver numbers, ordered as specified
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine sorts the driver list in driversInOrder according to the value
\ specified by argument A. It also populates carStatus with the position
\ numbers for the sorted driver list, which will typically run from 0 to 19,
\ but may also contain repeated numbers in the case of a tie.
\
\ The routine uses a basic bubble sort algorithm, swapping neighbouring drivers
\ repeatedly until the whole list is sorted. This is not very efficient, but as
\ this is only done when showing the driver table between races, that doesn't
\ matter.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   Determines the order of the sorted list to create:
\
\                           * 0 = best lap times
\
\                           * Bit 6 set = accumulated points
\
\                           * Bit 7 set = total race times
\
\ Returns:
\
\   positionNumber      A list of position numbers, from 0 to 19, ready to print
\                       in the first column of the driver table (with 1 added),
\                       with drivers who are tied in the same position sharing
\                       the same number
\
\   driversInOrder      A list of driver numbers, sorted according to the value
\                       specified by argument A

\
\ This routine is normally called with X as a multiple of 3 in the range 0 to

\ track section coordinates from the track section data for section Y * 8:
\
\   * xTrackSectionI
\   * yTrackSectionI
\   * zTrackSectionI
\
\ and stores them in the X-th coordinate in (xSegmentCoordI, ySegmentCoordI,
\ zSegmentCoordI). It also copies the following track section coordinates:
\
\   * xTrackSectionO
\   * yTrackSectionI
\   * zTrackSectionO
\
\ and stores them in the X-th coordinate in (xSegmentCoordO, ySegmentCoordO,
\ zSegmentCoordO). Note that the y-coordinate is set to the same value as the
\ y-coordinate from the first copy.
\
\ It also sets thisVectorNumber to trackSectionFrom for the Y-th track section
\ data.

\
\ This routine calculates the coordinates, flags and cornering data for the next
\ track segment. It does this in three parts:
\
\   1. Initialise up the new track segment, and fetch the segment vector for the
\      new track segment
\
\   2. Set the flags for the new track segment
\
\   3. Add the segment vector from part 1 to the coordinates for the current
\      track segment to get the coordinates for the next track segment
\
\ This part does the following:
\
\   * Move the index on to the next track segment
\
\   * Initialise the new track segment if we are entering a new track section
\
\   * Set pastHalfway
\
\   * Set (SS T), (TT U) and (UU V) to the xTrackSegmentI, yTrackSegmentI and
\     zTrackSegmentI vectors

\  Deep Dive: Drawing the track verges
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine tests whether the magnitude of a signed yaw angle is < 20. In
\ other words, given a signed yaw angle x, this tests whether |x| < 20.
\
\ As the field of view in Revs is 20 degrees, this tests whether or not a yaw
\ angle is visible on-screen.
\
\ It does this by adding 20 and then testing against 40, which gives the result
\ we want as the following are all equivalent:
\
\   -20 < x < 20
\
\   -20 + 20 < x < 20 + 20
\
\   0 < x < 40
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The index within the track verge buffer of the verge to
\                       check:
\

\
\                         * horizonListIndex      for the right verge
\
\ Returns:
\
\   V                   The result, where x is the verge yaw angle:
\
\                         * Bit 7 is clear if |x| < 20 (visible on-screen)

\   Category: Drawing the track
\    Summary: Map verges in the track segment list to track lines in the track
\             view
\  Deep Dive: Drawing the track verges
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine populates the leftSegment or rightSegment table (depending on the
\ arguments).
\
\ It does this by working its way through the verge buffer, from distant entries
\ at the start of the buffer, to closer entries at the end of the buffer. As it
\ goes, it looks at the pitch angles of the entries, which equate to track lines
\ in the track view, with high track lines matching high pitch values (which are
\ higher up the screen). It then fills the corresponding entries in the
\ leftSegment or rightSegment table, which have one entry per track line, with
\ the index numbers of the relevant entries from the verge buffer.
\
\ In other words, if we fill five entries in the rightSegment table with an
\ index n, then that means that the segment that's mapped to entry n in the
\ verge buffer will take up five track lines on-screen, so it will be five
\ pixels tall.
\
\ It's worth reiterating that the track verge buffer stores distant segments
\ first, coming towards us as we progress through the list, so leftSegment
\ and rightSegment are the reverse of this, with closest segments at the start,
\ furthest segments at the end. This matches the track lines, where small
\ numbers are at the bottom of the screen (i.e. close), high numbers are up
\ the screen (i.e. further away).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The low byte of the table address to populate:
\
\                         * LO(rightSegment) = populate rightSegment
\
\                         * LO(leftSegment) = populate leftSegment
\
\   Y                   Index of the last entry in the track verge buffer:
\
\                         * segmentListRight for the right verge
\
\                         * segmentListPointer for the left verge
\
\   X                   The index within the track verge buffer of the horizon:

\
\                         * horizonListIndex + 40 for the left verge
\
\ Returns:

\                       not waste time drawing their verges

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:

\
\   Y                   Determines the type of verge that we are drawing:
\
\                         * 0 = leftVergeStart, the left edge of the left verge

\                               verge
\
\                         * 3 = rightGrassStart, the right edge of the right
\                               verge
\
\   vergeBufferEnd      The index of the last entry in the track verge buffer
\                       for the side of the track we are currently drawing
\
\   pixelMaskVerge      Offset within the vergePixelMask table for segments that

\
\                         * 28 for rightGrassStart
\
\   pixelMaskNoVerge    Offset within the vergePixelMask table for segments that
\                       are too far away to show a verge
\
\                         * n/a for leftVergeStart

\
\   MM                  Set to 0, to act as the low byte of (NN MM)

\       Name: DrawObjectEdge (Part 1 of 5)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing objects
\    Summary: Draw the specified edge of an object part
\  Deep dive: Creating objects from edges
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part of the routine calculates the pixel x-coordinate of the edge, plus
\ the block number and pixel x-coordinate of the next edge (if there is one), so
\ we can use them in the next call to DrawObjectEdge.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   topTrackLine        Top track line of the edge (higher value, 0 to 79)
\
\   bottomTrackLine     Bottom track line of the edge (lower value, 0 to 79)
\
\   thisEdge            This edge (as a scaled scaffold measurement)
\
\   nextEdge            The next edge (as a scaled scaffold measurement)
\
\   xPixelCoord         The pixel x-coordinate of the centre of the object
\
\   colourData          Colour data:
\
\                         * Bits 0-1 = logical fill colour
\
\                         * Bits 2-3 = logical edge colour
\
\                         * Bit 4 = if set and this is a left or right edge,
\                           then use the fill colour instead of the edge colour
\                           if this is an outside edge (i.e. a left edge in the
\                           left half of the screen, or a right edge in the
\                           right half of the screen), so the edge is
\                           effectively hidden
\
\   A                   The fill colour to the right of the edge to draw:
\
\                         * For left edges: bits 0-1 contain the fill colour
\                           from bits 0-1 of the colour data
\
\                         * For right edges: contains 0
\
\                         * For extra edges: bits 0-1 contain the fill colour
\                           from bits 0-1 of the colour data
\
\   Y                   Edge type:
\
\                         * 0 = second or third edge in a four-edge object part
\                               (an "extra edge")
\
\                         * 1 = left edge
\
\                         * 2 = right edge
\
\   rightOfEdge         The fill byte to the right of the previous edge (or, if
\                       this is the first edge, the background colour to the
\                       left of the first edge)
\

\                       to draw this edge in the same pixel byte as the previous
\                       edge, this contains the pixel byte from the previous
\                       call with the first edge already drawn
\
\   blockNumber         For extra or right edges only: the dash data block
\                       number of the previous edge drawn by DrawObjectEdge
\
\   nextEdgeCoord       For extra or right edges only: the pixel x-coordinate
\                       of the edge to draw (as returned by the previous call to
\                       DrawObjectEdge)
\
\   nextBlockNumber     For extra or right edges only: the data block number of
\                       the edge to draw (returned by the previous call to
\                       DrawObjectEdge)
\
\   prevEdgeInByte      Determines whether we have already inserted the previous
\                       edge into the pixel byte we are building
\
\                         * 0 = there is no other edge in the pixel byte we are
\                               building
\
\                         * Non-zero = the previous edge is already in the pixel
\                                      byte we are building, and the current
\                                      edge needs to go in the same byte
\
\   edgePixelMask       For extra or right edges only:
\
\                         * 0 = there is no other edge in the pixel byte we are
\                               building
\
\                         * Non-zero = the pixel mask of the edge that was drawn
\                                      into rightOfEdge in the previous call
\
\ Returns:
\
\   blockNumber         The dash data block number that was drawn into
\
\   rightOfEdge         The fill byte to the right of the edge we just drew:
\
\                         * If we just successfully drew an edge and drew the
\                           result on-screen, this contains the fill colour of
\                           the object
\
\                         * If we created a pixel byte but the next edge needs
\                           to be drawn in the same byte, this contains the
\                           pixel byte from this call
\
\   edgePixelMask       The pixel mask of the edge that was drawn, which will:
\
\                         * Be empty if the previous edge was already drawn
\                           and we do not need to share this pixel byte with
\                           the previous edge
\
\                         * Contain set pixels for the previous edge if both
\                           this edge and the previous edge need to share the
\                           same pixel byte
\
\   nextEdgeCoord       The pixel x-coordinate for the next edge
\
\   nextBlockNumber     The dash data block number for the next edge
\
\   prevEdgeInByte      The correct setting for the next edge:
\
\                         * 0 if the next edge is not in the same byte as the
\                           one we just drew
\
\                         * Non-zero (bit 7 is set) if the next edge is in the
\                           same byte as the one we just drew (in which case the
\                           screen has not been updated, and the next call to
\                           DrawObjectEdge needs to insert the next edge into
\                           the pixel byte in rightOfEdge, using the pixel

\    Summary: Scale an object's scaffold by the scale factors in scaleUp and
\             scaleDown
\  Deep dive: Scaling objects with scaffolds
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used when drawing objects such as road signs, corner markers
\ and cars.
\
\ It takes the values from the objectScaffold table, which contain an object's
\ scaffold (i.e. all the essential measurements that we need to build the
\ object), and scales them according to the values of scaleUp and scaleDown.
\
\ As only scaffold measurements are used when drawing an object, this routine
\ scales the whole object, according to the two scale factors.
\
\ The value in scaleUp is the numerator of the scale factor, which scales the
\ scaffold up, so bigger values of scaleUp give bigger objects.
\
\ The value in scaleDown is the denominator of the scale factor, which scales
\ the scaffold down, so bigger values of scaleDown give smaller objects.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   QQ                  Index of the first objectScaffold entry for this object
\
\   II                  Index of the last objectScaffold entry for this object
\                       (where the last entry is index II - 1)
\
\   scaleUp             Numerator scale factor
\
\   scaleDown           Denominator scale factor
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Denotes whether the scaling was successful:
\
\                         * Clear if we manage to scale the scaffold
\

\   Category: 3D objects
\    Summary: Calculate the 3D coordinate of the specified car
\  Deep dive: Drawing a 3D car from 2D parts
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine calculates the 3D coordinate of the specified car, given its
\ progress through the current segment and the racing line, as follows:
\
\   [ xCoord2 ]   [ xSegmentCoordI        ]   [ xTrackSegmentI ]
\   [ yCoord2 ] = [ ySegmentCoordI mod 32 ] + [ yTrackSegmentI ] * carProgress
\   [ zCoord2 ]   [ zSegmentCoordI        ]   [ zTrackSegmentI ]
\
\                  [ xTrackSegmentO ]
\                + [        0       ] * carRacingLine * 4
\                  [ zTrackSegmentO ]
\
\                  [  0  ]
\                + [ 144 ]
\                  [  0  ]
\
\ In the above:
\
\   * xTrackSegmentI is the inner segment vector for the car's position
\
\   * xTrackSegmentO is the outer segment vector for the car's position
\
\   * xSegmentCoordI is the coordinate for the start of the car's track segment
\
\ The routine then calculates the yaw and pitch angles for the car object (or
\ objects).
\
\ This part calculates the 3D coordinate of the car along the inside edge of
\ the track, i.e. the first part of the above:
\
\   [ xCoord2 ]   [ xSegmentCoordI        ]   [ xTrackSegmentI ]
\   [ yCoord2 ] = [ ySegmentCoordI mod 32 ] + [ yTrackSegmentI ] * carProgress
\   [ zCoord2 ]   [ zSegmentCoordI        ]   [ zTrackSegmentI ]
\
\
\ The mod 32 part caps the y-coordinate to a maximum of 8192.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The driver number of the car object to build
\
\   thisDriver          Same as X
\
\   Y                   The index * 3 of the track segment to use for the
\                       calculation
\
\ Returns:
\
\   X                   X is set to the driver number in thisDriver
\
\   xCoord2             Contains the object's 3D coordinates (for the one-object
\                       car) or the coordinates of the rear tyres (for the
\                       four-object car

\
\ This table contains the low byte offset of the address of the STA (P),Y
\ instruction for the track line, which we convert into an RTS when drawing the
\ track line up against the right tyre, so we stop in time. As the tyres are
\ reflections of each other, we can also use this to calculate the starting
\ point for the line that starts at the left tyre: see part 3 of DrawTrackView
\ for details.

\  Deep dive: Trigonometry
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table contains values that are used to calculate the coordinates of the
\ end of the hand in the rev counter.
\
\ The contents of the table are very close to the following (the values from
\ the following calculation are shown in the comments below - they are close,
\ but not quite a perfect match, so I haven't got this exactly right):
\
\ FOR I%, 0, 21
\  EQUB INT(0.5 + 28 * COS((PI/4) * I% / 21))
\ NEXT
\
\ This gives the length of the adjacent side of a right-angled triangle, with a
\ hypotenuse of length 28, and an angle ranging from 0 to PI/4 (i.e. one
\ eighth of a circle), split up into 21 points per eighth of a circle.
\
\ In other words, if we have a clock whose centre is at the origin, then this
\ table contains the x-coordinate of the end of a clock hand of length 28 as it
\ moves from 3 o'clock to half past 4.

\ Palette data is given as a set of bytes, with each byte mapping a logical

\ 4-7 and the physical colour in bits 0-3. See p.379 of the Advanced User Guide
\ for details of how palette mapping works, as in modes 4 and 5 we have to do
\ multiple palette commands to change the colours correctly, and the physical
\ colour value is EOR'd with 7, just to make things even more confusing.
\
\ Each of these mappings requires six calls to SHEILA &21 - see p.379 of the

\  Deep dive: Trigonometry
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table contains values that are used to calculate the coordinates of the
\ end of the line on the steering wheel.
\
\ The contents of the table are very close to the following (the values from
\ the following calculation are shown in the comments below - they are close,
\ but not quite a perfect match, so I haven't got this exactly right):
\
\ FOR I%, 0, 37
\  EQUB INT(0.5 + 53 * COS((PI/4) * I% / 42))
\ NEXT
\
\ This gives the length of the adjacent side of a right-angled triangle, with a
\ hypotenuse of length 53, and an angle ranging from 0 to PI/4 (i.e. one
\ eighth of a circle), split up into 42 points per eighth of a circle (so the
\ table's 38 points cover just less than an eighth of a circle).
\
\ In other words, if we have a clock whose centre is at the origin, then this
\ table contains the x-coordinate of the end of a clock hand of length 53 as it
\ moves from 3 o'clock to half past 4.

\       Name: yLookupHi
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Drawing pixels
\    Summary: Lookup table for converting pixel y-coordinate to high byte of
\             screen address
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table returns the high byte of the screen address of the start of the
\ row, for the custom screen mode.
\
\ Note that the custom screen mode starts at address &5A80, so the first two
\ entries in this table do not point to screen memory; the first two character
\ rows in this table are off the top of the custom screen, so the first row
\ on-screen is the third row. This is why, when we print the top two lines of
\ text in the custom screen with the PrintCharacter routine, we do so at the
\ following y-coordinates:
\
\   * yCursor = 24 for the first line of text
\
\   * yCursor = 33 for the second line of text
\
\ To see where these are on-screen, we need to subtract 16 for the first two
\ character rows which are off the top of the screen, to give:
\
\   * y-coordinate = 8 for the first line of text
\
\   * y-coordinate = 17 for the second line of text
\
\ The value passed to PrintCharacter points to the bottom row of the character
\ to print, so the first coordinate points to the ninth pixel row (as the first
\ pixel row is row 0), and the second points to the 18th pixel row. There are
\ eight pixels in each character row, so this prints the first row of text so

\    Summary: Get the address of the specified driver's name
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine calculates the address of driver A's name using the following:
\
\   (Y A) = driverNames1 + (A div 4) * &100 + (A mod 4) * 12
\
\ The names of the 20 drivers are stored in in five blocks within the main game
\ code. Each block of contains four names, each of which is 12 characters long.
\ The blocks start every &100 (256) bytes, starting with the first block at
\ driverNames1 and going through to driverNames5.
\
\ Given driver number A, A div 4 is the block number, while A mod 4 is the
\ number of the 12-character name within that block. So we have:
\
\   * (A div 4) * &100 is the address of the start of the block containing the
\     name of driver A
\
\   * (A mod 4) * 12 is the offset of driver A's 12-character name within that
\     block
\

\     The colours of each letter in REVS are magenta/yellow/cyan/green
\     2 spaces
\
\     This token actually prints characters 141, 163, 157, 127 before printing
\     token 4 (which it does twice, one for each part of the header). 127 is
\     the DEL character, so this is the same as printing just 141 and 163,
\     which sets double-height, and then shows graphics character 163. This
\     latter character will blank as we are still in alphanumeric text mode...
\     so overall this just displays a double-height token 4, as token 4 contains
\     all the colour information for the individual letters
\
\   * Token 5 ("THE  PITS")
\     Column 11, row 4

\       Type: Variable
\   Category: 3D objects
\    Summary: The scaffold used to construct each object, in a scalable format
\  Deep dive: Scaling objects with scaffolds
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table contains an object's scaffold, in a format that supports quick and
\ easy scaling (see the ScaleObject routine).
\
\ Each object has its own scaffold, which contains all the measurements that we
\ need to build that object. The object is constructed using only measurements
\ from the scaffold, so if we want to scale the object, we can just scale the
\ scaffold.
\
\ Each object has a number of entries in this table, one for each scaffold
\ measurement, in decreasing order of size (so the largest measurements come
\ first). Each scaffold measurement is in one of these binary formats:
\
\   %00000ccc
\   %1abbbccc
\
\ where a = %a, b = %bbb and c = %ccc.
\
\ The value represented by %00000ccc is:
\
\       1
\   ---------
\   2^(c - 2)
\
\ and the value represented by %1abbbccc is:
\
\   a         1             1
\   -  +  ---------  +  ---------
\   2     2^(b - 2)     2^(c - 2)
\
\ In both cases, the result is a multiple of 1/32, so each of these entries
\ represents a fraction of the form n/32.
\
\ The ScaleObject routine takes the scaffold for a specific object and scales it
\ by multiplying each scaffold measurement by the following:
\
\     scaleUp
\   -----------
\   2^scaleDown
\
\ The resulting values are stored in the scaledScaffold table, which uses the
\ same structure as the object's section in the objectScaffold table, but
\ contains the scaled scaffold to use when drawing the scaled object.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following:
\
\   * liftFromTorque = the lift of the front of the car caused by accelerating
\     or braking, in the range -5 to +3
\
\ A positive value of liftFromTorque means the horizon is drawn lower on the
\ screen, which means the nose is being pulled up.
\
\ The value of liftFromTorque is only changed if the car is on the ground. The
\ logic is as follows:
\
\   * Horizon goes down when we are not in reverse, we are applying the throttle
\     and engine torque is non-zero (i.e. we pull the nose of the car up by
\     by incrementing liftFromTorque, to a maximum of 3)
\
\   * Horizon goes up when we are not in reverse, we are applying the brakes and
\     we are moving (i.e. we push the nose of the car down by decrementing
\     liftFromTorque, to a minimum of -5)
\
\   * Otherwise, gradually bring the nose back to the normal level of zero, with
\     the value incrementing towards zero at twice the rate that it decrements
\     towards zero (so the nose rises at twice the speed that it falls, as the
\     suspension springs are more powerful than gravity)

\    Summary: Multiply a 16-bit coordinate value and a 16-bit factor, optionally
\             tallying or changing the sign of the result
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine multiplies two 16-bit values and stores the result, optionally
\ negating the result, or adding it to the existing contents of the destination.
\
\ The first number (specified by parameter N, so let's call it variableN) is a
\ 16-bit signed integer, while the second number (specified by parameter X, so
\ let's call it variableX) is a 16-bit sign-magnitude number with the sign in
\ bit 0 of the low byte. The result is stored in the variable specified by
\ parameter K, so let's call it variableK.
\
\ The values of bits 6 and 7 of A affect the result as follows:
\
\   * If A = %00000000, then we calculate the following:
\
\     variableK = variableN * variableX
\
\   * If A = %01000000, then we calculate the following:
\
\     variableK = variableK + variableN * variableX
\
\   * If A = %10000000, then we calculate the following:
\
\     variableK = - variableN * variableX
\
\   * If A = %11000000, then we calculate the following:
\
\     variableK = variableK - variableN * variableX
\
\ Arguments:

\
\                         * Bit 7 defines the sign to apply to the result:
\
\                           * 0 = do not negate the multiplication
\
\                           * 1 = negate the multiplication

\     as follows:
\
\       * Set (A T) = trackGearRatio * playerSpeed * 8
\       
\       * If clutch is not engaged:
\       
\         * If any of these are true:
\       
\             * Throttle is not being applied
\             * playerSpeedHi >= 22
\             * This is a race and we are not showing the blue lights
\             * This is a race, we are showing the blue lights and still have 10
\               iterations until the green
\             * A >= revsOnGearChange, so the revs are higher than at the last
\               gear change
\       
\           then engage the clutch, otherwise clutch stays disengaged and we do:
\       
\             A = revsOnGearChange
\       
\             If A >= 108, A = A - 2 and revsOnGearChange = revsOnGearChange - 2
\       
\       * Set revCount = A
\       
\       * We now calculate the power being generated by the engine at this rev
\         count. First, we cap the rev count to a maximum of 170:
\       
\         max(170, revCount)
\       
\         so in the following revCount is this capped number.
\       
\       * If revCount < 3, turn the engine off, zero the torque and quit
\       
\       * If 3 <= revCount < 83, set A = A * 2 + 152
\       
\       * If 83 <= revCount < 87, set A = 186 - (revCount - 83)
\       
\       * If 87 <= revCount < 92, set A = 182 - ((revCount - 87) * 4)
\       
\       * If 92 <= revCount, set A = 162 - (revCount - 92) * 2
\       
\       * Set engineTorque = trackGearPower * A
\       
\       * Set soundRevTarget = revCount + 25

\    Summary: The 6845 registers for the custom screen mode
\  Deep dive: Hidden secrets of the custom screen mode
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The custom screen mode used during the race is based on standard mode 5, but
\ with the following differences:
\
\   * Horizontal sync position = 45 instead of 49
\
\   * Vertical displayed       = 26 instead of 32
\
\   * Vertical sync position   = 32 instead of 34
\
\   * Screen memory start      = &5A80 instead of &5800
\
\ So essentially it is a shorter mode 5 that takes up less memory, adjusts the
\ vertical and horizontal sync positions accordingly, and lives in screen memory
\ from &5A80 to &7AFF (as there are 26 character rows of 40 characters, with 8
\ bytes per character, giving 26 * 40 * 8 = 8320 bytes of screen memory, and
\ &5A80 + 8320 = &7B00).

\       Name: AwardRacePoints
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drivers
\    Summary: Award points following a race
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine awards points to a driver for finishing in the top six in a race,
\ or for getting the fastest lap time. The points awarded are based on the
\ driver's race position, as per the pointsForPlace table:
\
\   * 9 points for first place
\   * 6 points for second place
\   * 4 points for third place
\   * 3 points for fourth place
\   * 2 points for fifth place
\   * 1 point for sixth place
\   * 1 point for the fastest lap
\
\ In single-player races, the points are awarded as above.
\
\ In multi-player races, an algorithm is used to share out the points in a way
\ that takes the relative skills into consideration. Specifically, the routine
\ awards this many points:
\
\   (U T) * the points from the above list
\
\ This is how (U T) is calculated:
\
\ * Single-player race:
\
\   (U T) = numberOfPlayers = 1, so we award the amount of points shown above
\
\ * Multi-player race:
\
\   If we are awarding points to the current player:
\
\       (U T) = (numberOfPlayers - 1) * numberOfPlayers
\
\   If we are awarding points to a human player but not the current player:
\
\       (U T) = numberOfPlayers
\
\   If we are awarding points to a computer driver:
\
\       (U T) = (numberOfPlayers - 1) * 2
\
\ I have no idea why the algorithm works like this. It needs more analysis!
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The race position to award points to:
\
\                         * 0 to 5 for the first six places
\
\                         * 6 for the fastest lap

\    Summary: Print the table of drivers
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The driver table consists of the following:
\
\   * A header, as specified by the argument in X
\
\   * A table with one row for each driver, showing a number, a driver name and
\     a third column as specified by the argument in A
\
\   * A "PRESS SPACE TO CONTINUE" prompt below the table
\
\ If the table is being shown after practice or qualifying, the drivers are
\ shown in driver order, from 1 to 20, but if it is shown after a race, the
\ first column shows the numbers from the positionNumber table, the second
\ column shows the drivers in the order that they appear in the driversInOrder
\ list, and the race class is printed above the table.
\
\ The routine also waits for SPACE or RETURN to be pressed before returning.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The number of the token to print as the header (see
\                       PrintHeader for more details):
\
\                         * 1 = "POINTS"

\
\                         * 6 = "BEST LAP TIMES"
\
\   A                   Defines what to show in the third column in the table:
\
\                         * 0 = lap times
\
\                         * 4 = points awarded in the last race
\
\                         * &88 = accumulated points
\
\   positionNumber      A list of position numbers (for race tables only), which
\                       contains the numbers 0 to 19 in sequence, with tied
\                       positions represented by shared position numbers
\
\ Returns:

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine does the following:
\
\   * Set horizonLine+1 bytes at rightGrassStart to &80
\
\   * Set horizonLine+1 bytes at leftVergeStart to &80
\
\   * Set horizonLine+1 bytes at rightVergeStart to &80
\
\   * Set horizonLine+1 bytes at leftTrackStart to &80
\
\   * Set 80 bytes at backgroundColour to 0
\
\ Setting each of the four verge edges to &80 effectively pushes the edges off
\ the right edge of the screen, which resets the verge edges on that track line.
\ By resetting the first horizonLine+1 bytes in each verge edge block, we are
\ resetting all the edges for track lines below the horizon, i.e. from track
\ line 0 at the bottom of the screen to track line horizonLine+1 on the horizon.
\
\ Setting the 80 bytes at backgroundColour to zero resets the background colour
\ for all track lines.

\
\ This is implemented by the counter in raceStarting, which works like this.
\

\
\       Name: DRAW_BYTE
\       Type: Macro
\   Category: Screen buffer
\    Summary: Draw a pixel byte as part of a horizontal line when drawing the
\             track view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a row of four pixels (i.e. one byte) as part of the track
\ view.
\
\ The track view is drawn one line at a time, with each line being one pixel
\ high. Each of these lines is drawn as a sequence of bytes, with each byte
\ containing four pixels.
\
\ Each macro instance draws one pixel byte into screen memory, so that's one
\ four-pixel block within the horizontal line. So the full sequence of macros,
\ from DRAW_BYTE 0 through DRAW_BYTE 39, draws a one-pixel high line across
\ the full width of the screen. In other words, each DRAW_BYTE macro draws a
\ character block's worth of line, as the screen is 40 character blocks wide.
\
\ Each macro instance draws one pixel byte, from offset X within dash data block
\ I%, into screen memory. The offset X is decremented for each run through the
\ sequence of macros, as data is stored at the end of each dash data block. So
\ as each pixel line is drawn, moving down the screen, X decrements down from 79
\ (the start of each dash data block) as we work our way through the data.
\
\ The destination address in screen memory for the data is governed by (Q P),
\ which points to the address of the pixel byte to update in the first byte
\ (i.e. the address of the first pixel in the line across the screen).
\
\ If the dash data byte is zero, then the current value of A is stored in screen
\ memory (i.e. the same value that was stored in the previous byte).
\
\ If the dash data byte is non-zero, then this is stored in A and screen memory,
\ unless it is &55, in which a zero is stored in A and screen memory.
\
\ As it is copied, the source dash data byte is zeroed, so the macro effectively
\ moves a byte into screen memory, clearing it in the process.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   I%                  The pixel byte number (0 to 39)
\
\   X                   The offset within the dash data of the data to be drawn
\                       on the screen (from &7F down, as the dash data lives at
\                       the end of each dash data block)
\
\   A                   The value stored in screen memory in the previous pixel
\                       byte (or the starting value if this is pixel byte 0)
\
\   (Q P)               The screen address of the leftmost character block to
\                       update (i.e. the screen address of the pixel byte to
\                       draw in the first character block on the line, so this
\                       is the address of the start of the horizontal line that
\                       the seqential macros draw)
\
\   (S R)               Contains (Q P) + &100, to be used instead of (Q P) for
\                       pixel bytes 32 to 39

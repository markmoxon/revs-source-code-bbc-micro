\ where each section is one of the following shapes:
\
\   || is a straight section that doesn't curve to the left or right, and has
\      the same gradient throughout the whole section
\
\   {} is a straight section in the sense that it doesn't curve to the left or
\      right, but the gradient can differ between sub-sections
\
\   -> consists of sub-sections that all curve to the right
\
\   <- consists of sub-sections that all curve to the left
\
\   |->| consists of sub-sections that are either straight or curve to the right
\
\   |<-| consists of sub-sections that are either straight or curve to the left
\
\   |<->| consists of sub-sections that are either straight or curve to the left
\         or right
\
\ This part defines the following aspects of these track sections:
\
\ trackSectionData      Various data for the track section:
\
\                         * Bits 0-2: Size of the track section list
\
\                           Defines the number of entries that we store in the
\                           track section list for this section, which is used
\                           to calculate the coordinates of the track verges
\                           (higher numbers mean more sections are calculated,
\                           so higher numbers are used for more complex parts
\                           of the track)
\
\                           This value is given in the bottom nibble of the
\                           track section data byte (bit 3 is ignored), i.e. the
\                           second digit in the hexadecimal value
\
\                         * Bits 4-7: Sign number
\
\                           The number of the road sign (0 to 15) to show when
\                           we enter this section, but only if the sign number
\                           is different to the number in the previous section
\
\                           This value is given in the top nibble of the track
\                           section data byte, i.e. the first digit in the
\                           hexadecimal value
\
\ xTrackSectionIHi      High byte of the x-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the inner verge of each track section
\
\ yTrackSectionIHi      High byte of the y-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the inner verge of each track section
\
\ zTrackSectionIHi      High byte of the z-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the inner verge of each track section
\
\ xTrackSectionOHi      High byte of the x-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the outside verge of each track section
\
\ trackSectionTurn      The number of the segment towards the end of the section
\                       where non-player cars should start turning in
\                       preparation for the next section
\
\ zTrackSectionOHi      High byte of the z-coordinate of the starting point of
\                       the outside verge of each track section
\
\ trackDriverSpeed      The maximum speed for non-player drivers on the next
\                       section of the track

\  Deep dive: Dynamic track generation in the extra tracks
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine calculates the segment vector for the current segment, by
\ converting the direction of the track at this point, which is stored in the
\ yaw angle in (yawAngleHi yawAngleLo), into a direction vector to store in the
\ (xTrackSegmentI yTrackSegmentI zTrackSegmentI) tables in the track data file.
\
\ We also calculate the outer track segment vector (i.e. the vector across the
\ track) and store it in the (xTrackSegmentO yTrackSegmentI zTrackSegmentO)
\ tables in the track data file.
\
\ Note that the track segment vector tables overwrite the modification routines,
\ as those are no longer used, and the main game code still thinks that's where
\ the segment vector tables are stored as part of the track data file (which
\ they are, it's just that they are dynamically generated in the extra track
\ files, rather than being full of static data).

\
\ In the original code:

\   * If previous segment's yaw angle >= 20 then the previous segment was also

\   * Otherwise go to gseg4 to try reducing the size of the segment before

\
\ The code modifications are done in three parts.
\
\ The (modifyAddressHi modifyAddressLo) table contains the locations in the main

\ have been done. The routine is padded out to be exactly 40 bytes long, so
\ there's one byte for each inner segment x-coordinate.

\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Extra tracks
\    Summary: Configuration data for each section that defines the sub-section
\             numbers, and horizon calculations
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Each section has a trackSubConfig value that contains the following data:
\
\   * Bits 2 to 7 = the number of the first sub-section in this section
\
\   * Bit 1 = if this is set, then in the horizon calculations, we skip the
\             check that sets horizonLine to 7
\
\   * Bit 0 = if this is set, then the segment vectors for this section are
\             generated as a straight track rather than using the curve tables
\             (this bit is only set for straight sections)
\
\ In the last one, if bit 0 is set then bit 7 of subSection gets set. This makes
\ us skip the first part of the SetSegmentVector routine, which means we do not
\ update the yaw angle or track height before calculating the segment vector.
\ This means we reuse the segment vector from the end of the previous section
\ for generating this track section. This is only done for straight sections,
\ and the main game code draws straight sections by simply adding the same track
\ segment vector for each segment in the straight, so setting bit 0 of a
\ section's trackSubConfig ensures that it heads off in a straight line in the
\ exact same direction as the tail end of the preceding section.
